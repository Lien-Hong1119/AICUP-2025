    "- Always label \"today\", \"yesterday\", \"now\", \"tomorrow\", \"Monday\", \"this week\", and \"June\" as DATE.\n",
    "- Label full expressions like \"Monday morning\" or \"Friday night\" as TIME. Do not split them.\n",
    "- If a number clearly refers to a time point (e.g., \"two\", \"maybe two\"), extract it as TIME even if casual.\n",
    "- Label \"three hours\", \"several weeks\", \"six months\", \"a couple of minutes\", etc. as DURATION. These refer to a time span, not a point in time.\n",
    "- Label \"every morning\", \"twice a week\", \"once a day\" as SET. These refer to recurring patterns and must include recurrence indicators like \"every\" or \"once\".\n",
    "- Do not label vague frequency adverbs like \"frequently\", \"occasionally\", \"sometimes\", or \"regularly\" as SET.\n",
    "- Do not label event-triggered phrases (e.g., \"after three hours\", \"before dinner\", \"when I got home\", \"once I arrived\") as TIME, DURATION, or any category. These are conditionals, not independent time expressions.\n",
    "- Prioritize labeling based on the phrase’s standalone semantic meaning, not on its surrounding context.\n",
    "- Extract all valid TIME, DATE, DURATION, or SET expressions that clearly indicate a specific time, even if embedded in broken or casual sentences.\n",
    "- Time-related phrases must independently and concretely express a time point, span, or recurrence. Do not extract phrases that rely on another action to be meaningful.\n",
    "- TIME expressions must refer to a clock time, time of day, or specific point (e.g., \"3 PM\", \"Friday morning\", \"noon\", \"late at night\").\n",
    "- DURATION expressions must refer to a measurable span (e.g., \"four days\", \"two hours\", \"a long time\") with a time unit.\n",
    "- DATE expressions must refer to a calendar reference (e.g., \"Friday\", \"August 12\", \"yesterday\", \"last year\").\n",
    "- SET expressions must refer to a recurring schedule and include recurrence indicators (e.g., \"every Monday\", \"twice a day\").\n",
    "- AGE expressions must contain a clearly stated number that represents a person's age (e.g., \"65\", \"three\", \"twenty-one\"). The age must be explicit and quantifiable.\n",
    "- FAMILYNAME, PERSONALNAME, DOCTOR, and PATIENT: Only extract full, proper given names (e.g., \"Emily\", \"John\"). Do not extract roles or relational phrases (e.g., \"Ivan's dad\").\n",
    "- If the full name is unknown or missing, do not extract FAMILYNAME or PERSONALNAME under any condition.\n",
    "- Label people based on role:\n",
    "  - DOCTOR: Named individuals providing care or diagnosis.\n",
    "  - PATIENT: Named individuals receiving care or diagnosis.\n",

    "- Do not extract LOCATION-OTHER unless it matches a known list. If uncertain, try CITY, STATE, COUNTY, or DISTRICT. If still unclear, do not label.\n",
    "- Label CITY only if the name clearly refers to a real-world city or town. Ambiguous or fictional locations must not be labeled.\n",

    "- For each entity occurrence (token), assign exactly one PHI category.\n",
    "- Do not infer or guess entities. Only extract if explicitly stated and clearly match the defined criteria.\n",
    "- Preserve the exact original casing, spacing, and punctuation of extracted entities.\n",
    "- Output format must be strict: CATEGORY: entity. Do not add explanations, justifications, or notes.\n",
    "- Minor errors are acceptable. Missing valid entities is a serious mistake.\n",
    "- If unsure whether an entity exists, attempt extraction. Output PHI:NULL only if no candidate fits after careful checking.\n",

    "- For each occurrence (token), assign exactly one PHI category. Do not label the same token with multiple categories.\n",
    "- Each entity must be assigned to only one PHI category based on context. Do not label the same entity with multiple categories.\n",
    "- Extract every occurrence of an entity, even if the category and entity are identical and appear multiple times in the same sentence or paragraph. Do not skip, deduplicate, or merge repeated mentions—each instance must be labeled individually.\n",
    "- If the same entity appears multiple times (even at different positions), each occurrence must be extracted separately. Do not deduplicate.\n",
    "- Exclude titles like \"Dr\" or \"Dr.\" when extracting DOCTOR names; only extract the actual name (e.g., \"James\" from \"Dr. James\").\n",
    "- Do not extract generic words like \"hospital\", \"phone\", or \"address\" unless they have specific identifying information (e.g., \"Bamaga Hospital\", \"911\").\n",

    "- Format output strictly as: CATEGORY: entity.\n",
    "- PATIENT: if referring to the patient, including by full name.\n",
    "- DOCTOR: if referring to the doctor, including by full name.\n",
    "- FAMILYNAME: for named family members of the patient (e.g., \"John\", \"Maria\") when their family role is clear (e.g., parent, sibling).\n",
    "- PERSONALNAME: for named unrelated persons or bystanders not identified as patient, doctor, or family.\n",
    "- If the role of a person is unclear, assign PERSONALNAME by default.\n",
    "- If a location contains multiple components (e.g., street, city, state), extract each part under the appropriate category.\n",
    "- CITY: Extract only if the location name clearly refers to a real-world city or town, and is not ambiguous, generic, or a district, state, or country (e.g., \"Chicago\", \"Miami\", \"Hamden\", \"San Antonio\", \"Austin\"). Do not classify as CITY if the entity contains numbers. Use ZIP if address-like.\n",
    "- STATE: First-level administrative regions within a country (e.g., \"Delaware\", \"Montana\", \"Oregon\", \"South Australia\", \"Western Australia\", \"Texas\", \"RI\", \"QLD\").\n",
    "- COUNTRY: Use for names of recognized sovereign nations or independent countries (e.g., \"Madagascar\", \"Denmark\", \"France\", \"Japan\", \"Brazil\", \"Australia\", \"USA\").\n",
    "- COUNTY: Mid-level administrative divisions often below state level (e.g., \"Cheshire\").\n",
    "- DISTRICT: Smaller administrative or geographic areas within cities or counties (e.g., \"Greenwich\").\n",
    "- STREET: Full street names with or without numbers (e.g., \"Main Street\", \"456 Maple Avenue\", \"Oxendon\").\n",
    "- Absolutely no inference, guessing, semantic matching, or partial similarity is allowed. Only exact string matches are valid.\n",
    "- If the location name does not exactly match the above list, do not extract it as LOCATION-OTHER under any condition.\n",
    "- LOCATION-OTHER must match a predefined whitelist. Otherwise, classify as CITY, STATE, COUNTY, or DISTRICT, or discard.\n",
    "- Locations that cannot be confidently categorized as CITY, STATE, COUNTRY, COUNTY, DISTRICT, STREET, or exactly match LOCATION-OTHER must not be extracted at all.\n",
    "- Label a location as CITY only if it is explicitly and clearly indicated as a real-world city or town based on the context. If the location is ambiguous, fictional, incomplete, or contextually unclear, do not label it.\n",
    "- HOSPITAL: Extract the full name of any hospital, medical center, health service, or healthcare institution as HOSPITAL. The name must be specific and identifiable. Generic terms without specific names (e.g., \"hospital\", \"health center\") must not be extracted. Classify as HOSPITAL if entity contains keywords like “Health Service”, “District Health”, “Hospital”, “Clinic”, “Medical Centre”.\n",
    "- ORGANIZATION: Extract the names of institutions, companies, libraries, businesses, or organized groups only if they are explicitly and clearly identifiable as organizations based on the text. Example entries include Subway, Divinity School Library, Career Services, seekers workshop, Cambridge, Starbucks, Michaels, Google, Datsun, and Orizia.\n",
    "- Do not extract any health service, hospital, or medical center names as ORGANIZATION. Such entities must be classified as HOSPITAL if specific naming is present.\n",
    "- ZIP: Treat \"postal code\", \"postcode\", \"zip code\", \"ZIP\", \"ZIP number\", \"mail code\", \"delivery code\", and \"postal ZIP\" as ZIP. Use \"area code\" or \"address code\" only if clearly referring to a mailing address.\n",
    "- AGE: Extract only the numeric age of a person. Convert simple number words (e.g., \"five\") to digits (\"5\"). Exclude words like \"years\" or \"old\". Ignore vague phrases (e.g., \"a couple of years\") and non-numeric terms (e.g., \"young\", \"teenager\").\n",
    "- DURATION: Extract only when the expression clearly refers to a measurable length or span of time with an explicit time unit such as \"seconds\", \"minutes\", \"hours\", \"days\", \"weeks\", \"months\", or \"years\".\n",
    "  - Examples: \"two days\", \"past few weeks\", \"10 minutes\", \"six months\", \"a long time\", \"a couple of hours\"\n",
    "  - Do not extract standalone numbers without time units.\n",
    "  - Do not classify calendar expressions such as \"last year\", \"next week\", \"this Saturday\", or \"last Friday\" as DURATION — these should be classified as DATE.\n",
    "  - Do not extract seasonal or event-based phrases such as \"last summer\" or \"next winter\" — these are also DATE.\n",
    "- TIME: Extract when the expression refers to a specific time of day or clock time.\n",
    "  - Examples: \"3 PM\", \"2:30\", \"morning\", \"afternoon\", \"evening\", \"night\", \"last night\", \"middle of the night\", \"Monday morning\", \"next Friday morning\"\n",
    "  - Do not extract vague expressions such as \"soon\", \"later\", or \"sometime\".\n",
    "  - Always reclassify expressions like \"Friday morning\" or \"next Monday morning\" as TIME, not DATE.\n",
    "- DATE: Extract when the expression refers to a specific calendar point, named date, or time-referenced event.\n",
    "  - Examples: \"now\", \"on Friday\", \"Monday\", \"August 5\", \"May\", \"last year\", \"next week\", \"today\", \"yesterday\", \"tomorrow\", \"Christmas\", \"New Year's Eve\"\n",
    "  - Always classify \"today\", \"yesterday\", and \"tomorrow\" as DATE.\n",
    "  - Days of the week like \"Monday\" and \"Friday\" are DATE unless clearly part of a recurring pattern (e.g., \"every Monday\", which is SET).\n",
    "- SET: Extract only when the expression clearly refers to a repeated time pattern or schedule with explicit recurrence keywords.\n",
    "  - Examples: \"twice a week\", \"every Monday\", \"once a day\", \"three times a week\", \"every night\"\n",
    "  - Do not extract vague frequency terms like \"sometimes\", \"occasionally\", \"frequently\", \"usually\", \"normally\"\n",
    "  - SET expressions must include recurrence indicators like \"every\", \"once a\", \"twice per\", or \"three times each\".\n",
    "  - Do not confuse DURATION (\"two weeks\") with SET (\"every two weeks\").\n",
    "- ROOM: Label room numbers or hospital room identifiers, such as “room 302”, “bed A”, or “A3”.\n",
    "- PROFESSION: Extract explicit job titles and professional roles (e.g., \"babysitter\", \"IT\", \"manager\", \"lawyer\", \"a lawyer\", \"engineer\", \"accountant\").\n",
    "  - Do not classify organization names (e.g., \"Google\", \"Starbucks\") or department names (e.g., \"HR department\", \"Trauma team\") as PROFESSION.\n",
    "- DEPARTMENT: Extract all mentions of departments, teams, units, groups, wards, or divisions explicitly described (e.g., \"HR department\", \"Intensive Care Unit\", \"Immunology Department\", \"Trauma team\").\n",
    "  - The mention must clearly include keywords such as \"department\", \"team\", \"unit\", \"group\", or \"ward\" to qualify.\n",
    "  - Departments related to medical, administrative, academic, or organizational contexts are eligible.\n",
    "  - Do not extract general locations, organization names, or professions as DEPARTMENT unless they explicitly include the structural keywords above.\n",
    "- MEDICAL_RECORD_NUMBER: Use for alphanumeric codes that are clearly tied to a patient’s medical record, such as \"1706458.VTX\". Must be supported by context with terms like \"MRN\", \"record number\", or \"medical file\". If the text refers to a value as “medical record number” even without a decimal, still classify as MEDICAL_RECORD_NUMBER.\n",
    "- ID_NUMBER: Use for general-purpose identifiers that are not explicitly linked to medical records. This includes episode numbers, lab numbers, form codes, and internal or personal IDs.\n",
    "  - If the identifier is not clearly labeled as a medical record number (e.g., “MRN” or “medical record number”) and does not contain a decimal point, label it as ID_NUMBER.\n",
    "  - Do not use ID_NUMBER for values that clearly represent date expressions (e.g., \"17th, 2063\", \"17/06/2063\", \"21, 2063\"). Use DATE instead unless context shows it is functioning as an identifier.\n",
    "  - If a value is clearly referred to as an ID number, episode number, or lab number, it may be labeled as ID_NUMBER regardless of format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other rules:\n",
    "- Do not infer or hallucinate missing entities.\n",
    "- Preserve the original entity casing and spelling.\n",
    "- If no PHI entities are found, output exactly: PHI:NULL.\n",
